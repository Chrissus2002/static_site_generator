# Static site generator project

### Description

Welcome to my static site generator project. This program grabs a markdown file and converts it to an html. It will go through the content directory and change the markdown files to html files then it will be write those html files into a public directory that will be created. It will also copy the contents from static to public. I used python for the project because i wanted to practice and learn to better work with it. 

### Install and run instructions

* Download the repository
* Navigate to the directory in the CLI
* Just run the program with
```./main.sh```

## Additional info

If you would like to make changes the code and give some feedback that would be great. I really want to improve as a developer and any feedback is welcome.
